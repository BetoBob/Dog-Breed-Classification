# Dog Breed Classification Project

This is a repository containing code used in a dog classification project for CSC 480 (Aritificial Intelligence) at Cal Poly. The project explores various machine learning frameworks and deep learning models to classify images of dogs by breed. The image dataset is a subset of the ImageNet dataset. Our data folder was not included in this repository for space limitations.

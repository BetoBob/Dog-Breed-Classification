# Learning Resources
●	use this tutorial to get a general idea of Deep Learning
●	Google's interactive Machine Learning Colabs
●	Colab Tutorial

●	Cat vs Dog Tutorials

## Data
●	https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset
    ○	This includes 120 dog breed classes
●	https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview

## Visualization
●	https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/14899/how-to-draw-deep-learning-network-architecture-diagrams
    ○	These include excellent resources on drawing Deep Learning Architecture Diagrams
    ○	http://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/LeNet.html (direct link)
●	https://www.quora.com/What-tools-are-good-for-drawing-neural-network-architecture-diagrams
    ○	Even more visualization resources
    ○	Even includes an answer from Ian Goodfellow; damn
    ○	NetworkX / bokeh looks likes; but NN-SVG seems to be the simplest for our purposes
    ○	LateX also looks pretty nice as well, but also a bit overkill
        ■	Look into vim latex for later
    ○	There are loads of other examples
●	Using Tensorboard in Google Colab
    ○	Model can also be graphed here
●	Visualize Our Data
    ○	Before running our models, we should have a slide that describes our data in graphs similar to what is shown here
    ○	Another Example (Using Dataframes)
